### Volatility Modelling

Three different volatility models are examined for the return processes of financial assets. The models examined are given below with a corresponding volatility plot over time.

* EqWMA
* EWMA 
* GARCH(1,1) 

An example of a GARCH(1,1) volatility estimation for the S&P 500 index.

The models were also tested visually using QQ-plots and ECDFS. Other stylized facts were also examined for the return distributions.

### Dependency Modelling
 
While modelling multiple financial assets the dependency between the assets must be considered. In order to do this a multivariate distribution is required. This is done by using copulas in conjunction with the univariate distributions. In this notebook multiple copulas are used to fit **NOK/USD** and **EUR/USD** returns.

### Fund Performace
The 'Washington Mutual Investors Fund' (CWMAX) fund was be examined by its performance. Different performance metrics was be used to judge the fund returns. Multifactor methods was also employed to obtain a greater understanding of its performance.
