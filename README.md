# Volatility-and-Dependence-Modelling
Modelling volatility with EqWMA, EWMA and GARCH models. Using copulas to find a multivariate distribution of financial assets. Based on labs in Financial Risk Management at Liu.

## Volatility Modelling

The aim is to find good models for returns of financial assets. In doing so, I look at different ways to model volatility which is used extensivley in return modelling. The models examined are the EqWMA, EWMA and GARCH(1,1) models.

## Dependency Modelling
 
When modelling multiple financial assets the correlation between the assets must be considered. In order to do this we need a multivariate model of the assets. This is done by using copulae using the univariate distributions found in the eariler volatility modelling part.
